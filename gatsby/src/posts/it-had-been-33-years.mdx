title: It Had Been 33 Years

It had been over 33 years since I last saw her face to face. In that time, the smiling fourth grade girl had become a smiling woman with a smiling family.  I had glimpses into her life because, even though we have not spoken since 1987, we are "friends".

A few days ago I discovered that, apparently, we differ in political opinion, so when I saw a post of hers in my feed, I _had_ to react and set her straight. I posted. She countered. I posted again. We made a few rounds like this and, although our interaction was civil, it wasn't exactly cordial. In the end, I didn't convince her that I was right and she didn't convince me of the opposite. A normal day on Facebook. Cool? Cool.

The problem was that it wasn't cool and someone was wrong, _really_ wrong. It was me. I stomped into her space and subjected her to my judgement not stopping for a second to consider that I was overstepping my bounds. Since we were "friends" I had assumed she was speaking directly to me with her provacative political post, and it was my duty to make sure she acknowleged erroneous thinking. But, even thought the post came through _my_ feed, she had not been talking to me and was not waiting breathlessly for my validation. All I blindly thought was, "Aw, hell no!" and "This shall not pass!"

There is a prevailing tendancy to feel that we have to "call it when we see it" and not let anything we disagree with go unchallenged. We often forget that people's opinions aren't changed by constant confrontation, memes or snarky comments. All we do is foster hurt feelings and resentment and we're not convincing anybody. We're not going to change people's minds on the internet. Reactionary, offhand comments end up being more hurtful and divisive than the differences in opintion that generate them.

So, what should I have done? I should have respected her opinion and not intruded into her space. It was not my duty to impose my judgement on her thoughts. The record was not mine to correct, and how was I so sure that I was right, anyway. If I was so concerned about her well-being, why had I never once commented on any of her posts in a friendly, casual way or tried reconnect at all? After three decades of silence I could only be bothered to tell her how wrong she was regarding this one political comment. At the very least, I should have kept silent. I should have realized that I don't need to convince anybody of anything. I do not _need_ to convince anyone that my views are the right views. The only thing I _need_ to do is to demonstrate respect in any interactions that I have.

I am ashamed to admit that I have done this type of thing before and I will most likely do it again. I have been conditioned into a recationary bundle of outrage, and this will be difficult to undo. I take solace in the thought that every time I reflect back and recognize my disrespectful incursions I will be less likely to act that way in the future.
